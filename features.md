**Notty: A note taking application**

- User can take notes and categorise them
- Display the existing notes
- Allow the user to create, edit and delete notes
- We should be able to filter the notes based on category
- Store notes in localStorage
- Use an API to store notes and sync the data across the backend and what's stored in the local storage

**Stretch goals**

- Import and export notes
- Implement simple markdown previe for note content
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + N: New, Ctrl + D: Delete)
- The notes can either be arranged by name or latest edited/created
- Add a “last edited” timestamp and sort by last edited.
